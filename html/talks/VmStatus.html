# â€ŽStatusuebersicht Perl VMs

    German Perl Workshop, Dresden 7.5.2015
    40 min
    Reini Urban, cPanel

From outside the perl world looks bad.

*"In short, Perl 4 left the impression of spaghetti code,*

*Perl 5 crippled object orientation,*

*and Perl 6 received prominent vaporware awards and is too slow."* - Carrot

---
# Overview

- Perl 5 did a feature freeze after Larry Wall left

- is only doing maintenance

- discussions on p5p are fruitless

- features if implemented are one man shows

- there is no technical lead anymore

- no SW quality

- and no management

---
# Overview

Python, Ruby and PHP are of similar bad quality, but at least PHP got
a huge boost lately after their second management team got competition
in Facebook.

PHP 7 looks really good, if you forget about the old sins.

And Ruby is also doing much better. Started bad, but their superior design
pays off now.

---
# "Modern Perl"

Perl is post-modern by default, and people who
called out the "Modern Perl" movement have no idea about
Modernism.

Modern Perl is even more post-modern than p5p perl.
p5p perl is pretty modern actually.

My sig:

    Working towards a true Modern Perl.
    Slim, functional, unbloated, compile-time optimizable.

---

# perl 5.22
---
# perl 5.22

internal performance is up by 1.8. *(almost 2x faster!)*
---
# performance
* new **multideref** (by *davem*)

* not the new **op_signature** 30% (by *davem*)

* but esp. **cached class pointers** (by *syber@crazypanda.ru*)

  compile-time known class and method names are now
  pre-initialized into the class cache.
  SUPER::new is now parsed at compile-time.
---
# performance
* in @array = split the assignment can now be almost always optimized away.

* lots of more such lvalue assignment optimizations with other ops. (but still buggy
  in corner cases)

* NV (double numbers) can now be stored in the head only, no need for a seperate body.

* -fstack-protector-strong as new default made perl slower, and the added
  security is questionable.

* empty sub bodies containing only undef are now "inlined"

* non-utf8, non-magic length is now 20% faster

---
# features
* Unicode 7.0

* UNIVERSAL->import (e.g. use UNIVERSAL '...') is now fatal.
  This was deprecated for a while.
  This affects isa, can, VERSION. _perldoc UNIVERSAL_

* lots of fixes for NaN, Inf and locale dependent. NaN handling is now pretty good,
  when supported by the system.

* use re 'strict'
---
# features

* **use warnings 'all"** is not all anymore, added more warnings via extra, all is now everything.
  used for controversial warnings: grep in void context.

  Interestingly I wrote the same patch for some preloaded registered modules,
  but backed out some months ago. Now it's in. 
  *(My warnings are compiled into a extendable read-only hash in a shared library)*

* new optional OP\_PARENT, op\_sibling and op\_lastsib is gone. 
  rewritten pad API (again).
  actually the pad API and OP_PARENT are all very good things.
---
# syntax

* `<<>>` treats the @ARGV name as literal, same as the 3 argument open.

  that means `<>` was not fixed to ignore shellchars in filenames.
  ```
  push @ARGV, "|foo";
  while (<>)
  ```
  same as 2 arg open was also never fixed.
  ```
  my $fn = shift;
  open my $fh, $fn;
  ```
  instead opted for a new API, to keep the errors/features backcompat.

  perl5 is still a security minefield.
---
# syntax
* new refaliasing

  the lhs of an alias may now be a reference, and is
  automatically dereferenced:

  ```
    \$c = \$d;
    foreach \%hash (@array_of_hash_refs) { ... keys %hash }
  ```
---
# syntax
* new bitwise string operators (but still buggy)
* sub signatures parsed before attributes.
* defined(@array) and defined(%hash) are now fatal, but defined(@array = list) not.
* literal { needs to escaped in a regex (*lots of new warnings*)
* prefer subs over barewords with the * prototype
---
# syntax
* constant inlining of sub () { $var } may now throw deprecation
  warnings when the $var refers to a closed over variable, and a
  side-effect to change $var was ignored or not detected.  It
  produces however still wrong code.

  ```
    sub make_constant {
        my $var = shift;
        return sub () { $var }; # fine
    }
    sub make_constant_deprecated {
        my $var;
        $var = shift;
        return sub () { $var }; # deprecated
    }
    sub make_constant_deprecated2 {
        my $var = shift;
        change($var);           # could modify $var
        return sub () { $var }; # deprecated
    }
   ```
---
## problems
_(only a very tiny outline)_

**signatures** are still not acceptable:

* no types support 
  _(a 4 lines patch)_
* no call-by-ref 
  _(around 20 lines, but needs OP\_SIGNATURE restructuring which was not done in 5.22)_
* still copying the values to @\_ even when not needed, not using MARK yet as in the ops.
* too slow arity check at run-time. nothing done at compile-time.
* only primitive optimizations possible. (_empty bodies_)
* not merged with old protoypes syntax. need now to announce it as experimental,
  turn off the experimental warnings, even if not necessary,
  which disables old prototypes syntax. this was not the plan.
---
## problems

Nested subs and lexical values in subs are still not compiled properly
in corner cases.

still huge pure-perl hashes: unicode, config, warnings.

many critical modules still sourced, not builtin. 

the trend is even going into the opposite direction.
more deps, more bloat, more external modules.

---
## problems

regex compiler still a mine-field (e.g. ops via longjmp).

still not using non-backtracking optimizations (DFA re2),
even when they have to parse the regex in step 1.

still not using dynamic compilation,

i.e. two pass compilation: 1st for size and 2nd for the ops.

PCRE has a jit in the meantime.

---
## problems

silly new double readonly system.

silly old slow hash table,

new, slower hash function implementations. _(discussions fruitless)_

---
## problems

horrible old parser and new syntax extension API. 

_when they could use the parser, they rather add new spagetti functions instead._

_the newer the code the more the horror_

highlights: warnings, version objects, cow, op_signature.

---
## problems

With p5p no progress is possible, only bugfixes.

They are basically just maintaining the status quo, and even that not properly.

Most bugs are not getting fixed. 

---
## problems

The only possible successful workflow is to ignore p5p and do it by
yourself.

And that's what they are doing.

---
# parrot

Basically the similar management problems as p5p after the core
developers left after excessive infighting. 

Then, from 1.0 to 4.6 only destruction being done, much worse than the
infighting before.

But SW management tools and policies are still much better than in
perl5.

---
# parrot

Superior **threads** architecture. 

Only owner may write, the compiler automatically knows the owning
thread and assigns proxy objects to accessing threads. 

So it's basically lockless for all object types. Scales linear with
avail. CPU's.

Writes are done via prioritized deferred writer tasks in the owner thread.

---
# parrot

parrot performance is still terrible, but this is fixable.

It was fast before some people decided to destroy performance and
compatibility, for aesthetic reasons and lack of competence and management.

# parrot

TODO:

* fix win64 msvc

* the calling convention/runloop slowdown (20% perf win), 

* fixing string compacting GC (20% perf win),

* and the jit (100% perf win).

About 6 month work, but I stepped back again after the parrot/perl6
fiasco(*), working on our perl5 project now.

---
# MoarVM

The MoarVM project has my full sympathy as some parrot devs just had
no idea what they were doing, and it only got worse.
Jonathan did almost everything right.

Got stable and incredibly fast, even with a good optimizing jit now.
Working on NFG and the great list refactor now.

---
# MoarVM

However misses most of the old parrot SW quality infrastructure.
Tons of compiler warnings, wouldn't trust -O3.

Not buildable on macports, e.g.
---
# perl 6

Looks good.

Will go 1.0 end of this year

It already is out of beta and IMHO production ready for quite some
time, but they decided to rework list comprehension and enable unicode
normalization (NFG) in the remaining months.

---
# perl 6

_the "fiasco"_

dropped parrot support with an dumb excuse (NFG)

so you will not get lock-less threading on the vm level, you need to
trust the libraries. (Future, Promises)

also support for much less architectures now.

???

parrot support was discontinued for not understandable reasons. the
cited reasons were bogus and never reported.  there was no ticket, so
we never knew, prioritization could not be done and when we heard
about it, it was already too late for them.  apparently nobody but
froggs wants to work on the parrot backend.  you will not care, but
you should if you care about multithreaded performance.  moar and jvm
do not help there.

Technically cited was lack of Unicode NFG support, but no other VM has
NFG support either, and with parrot it's much more trivial to use the
existing icu Normalization2 API, which moar has to do now manually.

---
# Alternative VM's

_Remember: Compare this to the healthy state of other dynamic languages VM's:
php, ruby, python, javascript, lua_

---
# p2

p2 was my perl11 project to use a good small dynamic vm, potion written by
why the lucky stiff, to use as perl5 and perl6 backend. _(or ruby)_

Basically a lua variant with objects, and a simplier jit.

The features were already better than moarvm and parrot and of course
the old perl5 vm.

Function calls are 200x faster, nice jit, full dynamic MOP in under 10k LOC. 
E.g. I implemented BEGIN block support in one line of code.

---
# p2

In the last year I started adding a debugger, compiler framework, ffi,
unsafe fast arrays, numeric tower fixes and type support, but got
frustrated with the not yet GC-safe parser, complete lack of interest
(or competence), and strange performance characteristics in some
benchmarks.

---
# p2

TODO:
* gc-safe parser
* threads
* perl5 and perl6 library methods
* fill the perl6 parser with actions

---
# tvmjit

Francois Perrad's luajit variant with s-expressions.

He has a working nqp, with the perl6 mop.

Has a language client already.

---
# gperl

gperl is a llvm backed parser and jitted runtime by **gocchi** from Japan.
Even faster than p2.

He still has a mind-blocking bug in the parser with eval, and stepped
back to work on the submodules. Lexer, Parser, Compiler.

???
His english is not really good.

---
# rperl

It is a **restricted perl**, which favors **typed**, **no-magic** data
structures, which can be compiled to pure **C++ stdlib** structures, and
some operations on those are therefore as fast as possible.

It has it's own (*new*) parser for the extended syntax, and can
fallback from C++ ops to normal dynamic perl ops. 

Standalone it is already usable, which is a major accomplishment.

---
# perl11

The further plan is to compile modules into shared libs and use such compiled libs,
compiled with

* the standard and stable B::C , but during run-time not faster, fully dynamic perl5 vm,
* type optimized B::CC libraries, unrolled runloop, most ops optimized.
* type optimized rperl compiled into C++.
via perlcc and a new buildcc tool to manage the dependencies.

---
# compiler

e.g. with cPanel a typical binary is 50MB, has 200 modules
dependencies, has almost zero startup-time(*), perl5 bound run-time,
and again almost zero destruction-time.

most modules are already compiled in (i.e. just mapped into the
process space, even if not used), shared libs are loaded at startup.
only some bigger modules not constanty used are run-time loaded from
source, not yet via `.pmc`.
